Pittsburgh AI Camp is a summer `Project Bounty Program` for high school students. Our students learn to build software applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Project Bounties, as we call them, are projects with monetary values attached to them. 

Summer Camp begins **June 17th, 2024** 🏴‍☠️
